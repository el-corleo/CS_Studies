- Understand the different types of pentesting and the most common things to be checked with each:
  - External/Internal Network
    - Active Directory
  - Web Application
    - OWASP
  - Physical
    - Social Engineering (Phishing, Vishing, Spear Phishing, etc.)
  - Mobile
  - IoT

- Note taking:
  - Make sure to keep detailed notes:
    - Descriptive commentary
    - Dates
    - Screenshots of results (consider Greenshot on Windows, or Flameshot on Linux)


- MAC Addresses are used as device identifier for switching (layer 2)
- IP Addresses are used as host identifiers (layer 3)
  - IPv4 makes heavy use of NAT so that a single IP Address can have subnets
    - NAT makes use of ports to make multiple connections at the router level
- TCP and UDP are protocols for the transfer of data (layer 4)
  - TCP is connection-oriented, and offers reliable, slow data transfer
    - Useful for file transfers, or data transfer where integrity is paramount
    - Defined by SYN > SYN ACK > ACK process to establish a connection
    - Common ports/protocols:
      - 21  -> FTP
      - 22  -> SSH
      - 23  -> Telnet
      - 25  -> SMTP (email) 
      - 53  -> DNS
      - 80  -> HTTP
      - 110 -> POP3 (email)
      - 139 -> SMB (file shares)
      - 143 -> IMAP (email)
      - 443 -> HTTPS
      - 445 -> SMB (file shares)
  - UDP is connectionless, and offers best effort, fast data transfer
    - Useful for streaming, VoIP, etc.
    - Common ports/protocols:
      - 53  -> DNS
      - 67  -> DHCP
      - 68  -> DHCP
      - 69  -> TFTP (like FTP, but using UDP)
      - 161 -> SNMP


- OSI Model
  Pneumonic: Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away
  Layer 1 - [P]hysical layer: cables, hardware
  Layer 2 - [D]ata layer: switches, MAC addresses
  Layer 3 - [N]etwork layer: IP Addresses, routing
  Layer 4 - [T]ransport layer: TCP/UDP
  Layer 5 - [S]ession layer: session management
  Layer 6 - [P]resentation layer: media, wmv, jpg, mov
  Layer 7 - [A]pplication layer: HTTP, SMTP


- Subnetting
  - /x is the CIDR notation
    - Classless Inter-Domain Routing
  - /24 is the most common for a home network
    - subnet mask 255.255.255.0
  - /16 can occur for larger organizations that will have moe devices connected to the network
    - subnet mask 255.255.0.0
  - Can technically have /1 ~ /32
    - i.e, (2^32) - 2 devices ~ 1 device
  - First address of the block (usually) is the network ID
  - Last address (usually) is the broadcast ID

- Useful commands
  $ grep 'sudo' /etc/group
    - find all users in the sudoers group
  $ ip a
    - list all networking devices and interfaces
  $ ip n
    - list all neighbors to this device
  $ ip r
    - list routes

- Services
  $ sudo service apache2 start
    - starts a webserver on the localhost
  $ sudo service apache2 stop
    - stops a webserver on the localhost
  $ python3 -m http.server 80
    - starts a server on port given as parameter (80 in the above example)
    - this exposes all files within the directory from which the command is run
  $ sudo systemctl enable ssh
    - enables ssh on the machine in perpetuity
    - replace enable with disable to have the opposite effect

- Sockets
  - Sockets are used to make a connection between ports and IP addresses
