Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
  - A Layer 4 Protocol
  - Deals with: packet loss, duplication, and reordering
  - Provides reliable flow of data
  - Divides data into appropriately sized chunks
  - Acknowledges received packets, sets timeouts to wait for others' acknowledgements

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
  - Allows applications to send messages that preserve message boundaries
  - Application Layer must be responsible for reliable as UDP allows transfer of datagrams,
    but cares not for their safe arrival

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) 7-Layer Model

  7 - Application - user-initiated procedures
  6 - Presentation - information formats (JSON?)
  5 - Session - establishing, closing, restarting connections
  4 - Transport - ??
  3 - Network - ??
  2 - Link - single link communication protocols
  1 - Physical - connectors, data rates, how bits are encoded

A datagram is a basic transfer unit of a packet-switched network.
  - Typically have headers and payload
  - Delivery, arrival time, and order of arrival are not guaranteed by the network
  - Can be fragmented, i.e., a single file sent in multiple fragments that will be reassembled

Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is a unit of info transmitted among peer entities of a computer network.
  - Examples:
    - Packet
    - Segment
    - Datagram

There are different modes of forwarding packets:

  1.) unicast - destined for a single host
  2.) broadcast - destined for all hosts on a given network
  3.) multicast - destined for a set of hosts belonging to a multicast group (??)


Internet Control Message Protocol (IMCP)
  - Used to exchange error messages and other vital info with the IP layer


Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)
  - Used to manage which hosts are members of a multicast group
