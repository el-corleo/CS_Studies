Array
	- Advantages:
		- Random access is O(1)
		- Contiguous memory
		- Sortable
	- Disadvantages
		- Fixed size (expansion/contraction requires making new array and copying values over)
	- Great for:
		- Collections of a known, fixed size
		- Matrices
		- Hash tables

Linked List
	- Advantages:
		- Easily expandable/contractable
	- Disadvantages:
		- Memory not necessarily contiguous
		- Not (easily) sortable
		- Search is O(n)
	- Great for:
		- ???
	- Types:
		Singly Linked
			- Can only traverse in one direction
		Doubly Linked
			- Can traverse in both directions

Heap

	- Great for:
		- Priority Queues

Tree

	- Great for:
		- BSTs

Trie
