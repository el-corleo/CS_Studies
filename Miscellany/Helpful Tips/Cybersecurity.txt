LINUX

---- Spoofing IP address ----
$ ifconfig <interface> xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx		// changes interface's IP address to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
e.g., ifconfig eth0 192.168.8.192	
options, ifconfig <int> xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx	netmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx broadcast xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

---- Spoofing MAC address ----
$ ifconfig eth0 down						// takes down the interface
$ ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55	// changes the address of the ethernet interface
$ ifconfig eth0 up							// restarts the interface

---- Getting new IP from DHCP server ----
$ dhclient <interface>						// sends a DHCPDISCOVER request and changes IP upon receipt of DHCPOFFER

---- Collect DNS info ----
$ dig <website URL> <options>				// gets IP info for the website in question
											// options include ns (nameserver), mx (mail exchange)

---- Modify hosts file ----
$ sudo vi /etc/hosts						// enter edit mode for hosts file

127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 kali
192.168.181.131 bankofamerica.com			// add IP address to URL mapping (tab separated)

---- Hiding Tracks ----
$ set HISTORY=0								// temporarily sets CLI history storage length to 0
$ <command> > /dev/null						// this obfuscates the output from the command

---- Bash Scripting ----
#! /bin/bash								// tells the OS to use the bash interpreter to read the script (can use Python, etc.)
<command>									// type in any command you could use in bash
											// NOTE: that you might have to set execute permissions on the script after creation

#! /bin/bash

echo "What's your name?"

read name

echo "Hello, $name! Nice to meet you!"

NOTES:

C.I.A. - Confidentiality - Integrity - Accessibility

  1.) Confidentiality refers to control of access to resources: only authorized individuals
      can access resources.
  2.) Integrity refers to the resources themselves: a program with a backdoor has had its
      integrity compromised.
        a.) One appropriate question to ask is whether the software being used has been
            tampered with (checksums can help answer this)
  3.) Accessibility refers to the ability to access a given resource: a DDoS attack floods
      the server with requests making it impossible for even authorized individuals to access
      resources.

Threat Matrix - A framework for limiting the infinite attack vector space to a manageable size.

  1.) Hardware - Software - Information
    a.) Hardware involves a physical device being compromised: e.g., with a hidden chip in the
        device.
    b.) Software involves programs run on the hardware: e.g., software with a Trojan Horse.
    c.) Information involves sensitive data: e.g., medical records, or company trade secrets.
  2.) Insider - Outsider - Combined
    a.) Insiders are attackers who come from within the organization itself.
    b.) Outsider are attackers who have no affiliation with the organization.
    c.) Combined attackers come from collusion between insiders and outsiders.

Communication Channels

  1.) Overt - using a method of communication that was intended as a medium of communication.
  2.) Covert - hiding communication within media that were not originally intended for that
      purpose.

Security is a tradeoff

  1.) Cost
  2.) Convenience
  3.) Resources
