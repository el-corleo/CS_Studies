C.I.A. - Confidentiality - Integrity - Accessibility

  1.) Confidentiality refers to control of access to resources: only authorized individuals
      can access resources.
  2.) Integrity refers to the resources themselves: a program with a backdoor has had its
      integrity compromised.
        a.) One appropriate question to ask is whether the software being used has been
            tampered with (checksums can help answer this)
  3.) Accessibility refers to the ability to access a given resource: a DDoS attack floods
      the server with requests making it impossible for even authorized individuals to access
      resources.

Threat Matrix - A framework for limiting the infinite attack vector space to a manageable size.

  1.) Hardware - Software - Information
    a.) Hardware involves a physical device being compromised: e.g., with a hidden chip in the
        device.
    b.) Software involves programs run on the hardware: e.g., software with a Trojan Horse.
    c.) Information involves sensitive data: e.g., medical records, or company trade secrets.
  2.) Insider - Outsider - Combined
    a.) Insiders are attackers who come from within the organization itself.
    b.) Outsider are attackers who have no affiliation with the organization.
    c.) Combined attackers come from collusion between insiders and outsiders.

Communication Channels

  1.) Overt - using a method of communication that was intended as a medium of communication.
  2.) Covert - hiding communication within media that were not originally intended for that
      purpose.

Security is a tradeoff

  1.) Cost
  2.) Convenience
  3.) Resources
