---- Spoofing IP address ----
$ ifconfig <interface> xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx		// changes interface's IP address to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
e.g., ifconfig eth0 192.168.8.192	
options, ifconfig <int> xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx	netmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx broadcast xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

---- Spoofing MAC address ----
$ ifconfig eth0 down						// takes down the interface
$ ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55	// changes the address of the ethernet interface
$ ifconfig eth0 up							// restarts the interface

---- Getting new IP from DHCP server ----
$ dhclient <interface>						// sends a DHCPDISCOVER request and changes IP upon receipt of DHCPOFFER

---- Collect DNS info ----
$ dig <website URL> <options>				// gets IP info for the website in question
											// options include ns (nameserver), mx (mail exchange)

---- Modify hosts file ----
$ sudo vi /etc/hosts						// enter edit mode for hosts file

127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 kali
192.168.181.131 bankofamerica.com			// add IP address to URL mapping (tab separated)

---- Hiding Tracks ----
$ unset HISTFILE							// clears the variable where the history file is stored, so nothing is stored
$ set HISTORY=0								// temporarily sets CLI history storage length to 0
$ <command> > /dev/null						// this obfuscates the output from the command
$ shred <filename>							// deletes and overwrites the file several times to avoid forensic recovery
											// NOTE: Does not work on all filesystems
$ service <service name> stop				// stops named service, e.g., rsyslog to disable logging or ufw to disable the firewall

---- Bash Scripting ----
#! /bin/bash								// tells the OS to use the bash interpreter to read the script (can use Python, etc.)
<command>									// type in any command you could use in bash
											// NOTE: that you might have to set execute permissions on the script after creation

#! /bin/bash

echo "What's your name?"

read name

echo "Hello, $name! Nice to meet you!"

---- MYSQL ----
$ mysql -u <username> -p <URL>		// connect to a remote MySQL server under a given username
mysql> show databases;				// shows a list of all databases on server
mysql> use <database name>;			// load db for querying
mysql> show tables;					// shows a list of all tables in the currently loaded db
mysql> describe <table name>;		// shows information about fields, types, nullability, etc. for a given table

---- PROXY CHAINS ----
$ proxychains <command> <args>		// performs commands by tunneling traffic through proxies specified in /etc/proxychains.conf
									// e.g., $ proxychains nmap -sT -Pn <IP address>
									// comment out strict_chain and dynamic_chain, then uncomment random_chain and chain_len
									// don't use free proxies, as you're likely the product

---- MAPPING IP ADDRESSES ON LOCAL NETWORK ----
$ sudo arp-scan --interface=eth0 --localnet		// find all IP addresses on the local network

NOTES:

C.I.A. - Confidentiality - Integrity - Accessibility

  1.) Confidentiality refers to control of access to resources: only authorized individuals
      can access resources.
  2.) Integrity refers to the resources themselves: a program with a backdoor has had its
      integrity compromised.
        a.) One appropriate question to ask is whether the software being used has been
            tampered with (checksums can help answer this)
  3.) Accessibility refers to the ability to access a given resource: a DDoS attack floods
      the server with requests making it impossible for even authorized individuals to access
      resources.

Threat Matrix - A framework for limiting the infinite attack vector space to a manageable size.

  1.) Hardware - Software - Information
    a.) Hardware involves a physical device being compromised: e.g., with a hidden chip in the
        device.
    b.) Software involves programs run on the hardware: e.g., software with a Trojan Horse.
    c.) Information involves sensitive data: e.g., medical records, or company trade secrets.
  2.) Insider - Outsider - Combined
    a.) Insiders are attackers who come from within the organization itself.
    b.) Outsider are attackers who have no affiliation with the organization.
    c.) Combined attackers come from collusion between insiders and outsiders.

Communication Channels

  1.) Overt - using a method of communication that was intended as a medium of communication.
  2.) Covert - hiding communication within media that were not originally intended for that
      purpose.

Security is a tradeoff

  1.) Cost
  2.) Convenience
  3.) Resources

Defense in Depth / Offense in Depth

  1.) When defending a system, it's important to have multiple obstacles for the would-be hacker to deal with
	a.) Firewall -> ACLs/Whitelists -> Permissions
  2.) Whend attacking a system, it's important to hide behind multiple layers (Sparc Flow)
	a.) Use a volatile USB bootable OS, like Tails
	b.) Use a public wifi spot in a location far removed from your residence to connect to a VPN
	c.) Use the paid VPN service that keeps no logs and is located in a neutral country to connect to a VPS
	d.) Use a (crypto) paid Virtual Private Server to conduct all attacks
