- Mutually exclusive columns describe the state of features within the project

		WAIT		|		ANALYZE							|	IMPLEMENT	|	VERIFY		|		DELIVER
(No work done)			(Determine what needs to be done)		(Do it)			(Test it)		(Give to customer)


- Columns can be further subdivided to demonstrate a pool of WIP and a pool of ready for the next phase

		WAIT		|		ANALYZE				|	IMPLEMENT			|	VERIFY			|		DELIVER
					|Specifying | Ready for Dev	|Coding | Ready for Test|Testing | Accepted	| Deploying	| Value Added
					

- Columns can also include numbers specifying max num of allow items

- It's important to clearly define what constitutes "DONE" for each column
	- It is often useful to have a checklist of conditions that must be met so that the person responsible for items in a given column can decide whether or not they have completed their work
	
- Estimates can be made with a 95% confidence interval by tracking how long tickets take to deliver and then selecting the lowest # of days @ or above the 95th percentile (e.g., with a 20-ticket history, you would choose the 19th largest number as the estimate).
	- This would work well even with outliers, so long as the middle 90% (i.e., 5%-95%) have low variance
