/*
* Complexity: O(1.39 N log N) [39% more compares that Merge Sort, but done in-place, so faster]
* Unstable because of long range swaps that will change previous ordering
*
* Algorithm: TODO
* -Randomly shuffle
* -Partition, maintain two indexes and swap when finding items that remain on opposite
* sides of the partition
* -Sort
*
* divide and conquer
