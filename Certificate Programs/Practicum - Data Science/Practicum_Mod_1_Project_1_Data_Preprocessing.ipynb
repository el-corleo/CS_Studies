    "From the raw numbers, people who are married or in civil partnerships tend to default the most (accounting for roughly approx. 76% of all defaults); those without partners tend to default the least (accounting for the remaining approx. 24%). But we see that only approx. 57% of childless couples defaulted, whereas, approx. 75% of childless singles defaulted, thus hinting at insights. Furthermore, we need to first discover how many borrowers were couples vs. singles, for if over 1200 couples defaulted on their loans, but they account for over 20,000 of the total borrowers, then 1200 doesn't seem like as large a number anymore.

However, this could be due to most low income loan-seekers being denied loans by banks, and thus they only account for a small fraction of borrowers."
