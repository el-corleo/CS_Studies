Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
  - A Layer 4 Protocol
  - Deals with: packet loss, duplication, and reordering
  - Provides reliable flow of data
  - Divides data into appropriately sized chunks
  - Acknowledges received packets, sets timeouts to wait for others' acknowledgements

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
  - Allows applications to send messages that preserve message boundaries
  - Application Layer must be responsible for reliability as UDP allows transfer of datagrams,
    but cares not for their safe arrival

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) 7-Layer Model

  7 - Application - user-initiated procedures
  6 - Presentation - information formats (JSON?)
  5 - Session - establishing, closing, restarting connections
  4 - Transport - ?? (TCP belongs here, I think)
  3 - Network - ??
  2 - Link - single link communication protocols
  1 - Physical - connectors, data rates, how bits are encoded

A datagram is a basic transfer unit of a packet-switched network.
  - Typically have headers and payload
  - Delivery, arrival time, and order of arrival are not guaranteed by the network
  - Can be fragmented, i.e., a single file sent in multiple fragments that will be reassembled

Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is a unit of info transmitted among peer entities of a computer network.
  - Examples:
    - Packet
    - Segment
    - Datagram

There are different modes of forwarding packets:

  1.) unicast - destined for a single host
  2.) broadcast - destined for all hosts on a given network
  3.) multicast - destined for a set of hosts belonging to a multicast group (??)


Internet Control Message Protocol (IMCP)
  - Used to exchange error messages and other vital info with the IP layer


Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)
  - Used to manage which hosts are members of a multicast group


Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) & Interactive Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) are email-related transfer protocols

"This notion [that separate, non-interoperable smaller networks were not as valuable as one large, interoperable network] is the basis for the so-called Metcalfeâ€™s Law, which states roughly that the value of a computer network is proportional to the square of the number of connected endpoints (e.g., users or devices)."

"...it is worth observing that the Internet architecture delivers IP datagrams based on destination IP addresses. As a result, malicious users are able to insert whatever IP address they choose into the source IP address field of each IP datagram they send, an activity called spoofing."


"The resulting datagrams are delivered to their destinations, but it is difficult to perform attribution. That is, it may be difficult or impossible to determine the origin of a datagram received from the Internet."


"In TCP/IP, the distinction between the network layer and the transport layer is critical: the network layer (IP) provides an unreliable datagram service and must be implemented by all systems addressable on the Internet, whereas the transport layers (TCP and UDP) provide an end-to-end service to applications running on end hosts."


"The most common API for TCP/IP networks is called sockets."
  - I've heard the term 'sockets' many times before, but need more exposure before having a solid grasp of what they are and what their existence entails
